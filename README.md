# portfolio

## I did the following steps to complete my porfolio project.

+ Created a HTML structure in HTML file and added 'lang' attribute.
For making my site responsive, added '<meta>' tag along with 'viewport' attribute.
+ Created different areas like header, banner, cars _by_ using symantic tags 'header','section'.
+ Applied few styles for those elements by using external css ('css/style.css').
+ Downloaded few **images** and placed those images in folder named 'images'.
+ Declared those images in 'index.html' by using '<img>' tag along with 'src' and 'alt'.
